This Android game is an Alpha version for testing purposes. 

The game is a simple 2D online turned based game. 

The game is being developed using Android Studio.

# Instructions

If you are one of my testers, you need to test the game in at least two different devices running Android and set them up to find a match using the same difficulty configuration in game.

*Be aware that if you try to test the game with a single device the game will try to find a match but, because is a not open beta version or release version, the odds to find a player online to play against are very low.

# Disclaimer

The game has not been fully tested on different devices, this is the first alpha version so, could have unknown bugs, if you find one or would like to test the game, please do not hesitate to contact me, you can email me at andressbox90@gmail.com

Any feedback is appreciated.
